If we were to document this, we would have a row of data for each home, so that one record is one tap. That means our database would contain about 1 million rows of data, which may slow our systems down. For now, the surveyors combined the data of many households together into a single record.\n\nFor example, the first record, AkHa00000224 is for a tap_in_home that serves 956 people. What this means is that the records of about 160 homes nearby were combined into one record, with an average of 6 people living in each house (160 x 6 ≈ 956). So 1 tap_in_home or tap_in_home_broken record actually refers to multiple households, with the sum of the people living in these homes equal to number_of_people_served.",
