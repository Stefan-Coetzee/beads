Maji Ndogo is a country facing a serious water crisis, and the government is turning to data-driven solutions to understand and fix the problem.\n\nYour first task is to read an important message from **President Naledi** herself. This sets the context for everything you'll be doing.\n\nHere's the message:\n\n---\n\n**Message from President Naledi:**\n\n*\"Welcome to the Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Response Team. Our nation faces an unprecedented challenge. Across our regions, access to clean water is inconsistent, and we've seen the human cost of this crisis\u2014from health impacts to lost economic productivity.*\n\n*We need your expertise as a data analyst. The Ministry of Water and Infrastructure has collected extensive data about water sources, infrastructure, and service delivery across our regions. But data alone doesn't solve problems. We need insights.*\n\n*Your mission is to investigate this data, uncover the root causes of our water crisis, and provide actionable recommendations that will guide our government's response.*\n\n*The stakes are high. Families depend on this. Communities depend on this. I'm counting on you.*\n\n*President Naledi\"*\n\n---\n\nNow, Thabo, take a moment and think about this: **What do you think President Naledi is asking you to do as a data analyst?** What's your first impression of the mission?",

I need to look at all the information about water - like where it comes from, if the pipes are working, which areas have problems - and then use the data to show them what is happening.

You're asking about **geography** (regions), **infrastructure types** (sources), **scale** (how many people), **equity** (who's affected most), and **history** (what's been tried). That's sophisticated thinking.\n\nHere's the thing though\u2014and this is important: **we're about to find those answers together, in the data itself.**\n\nThe beautiful part of this project is that you won't just *be told* the context.

You ask questions, then you dig into the data to answer them.\n\nSo right now, you've done something crucial: you've set your mental framework. You know what you're looking for. That's your roadmap.\n\nNow, the next step in your journey is to actually **meet the data**\u2014to understand what information the Ministry has collected for you. What tables exist? What does each one contain? What can you actually measure?\n\nBefore we do that though, I want to make sure you're ready.

This is... this is not sustainable, is it? People waste time, they get tired, maybe children don't go to school because they fetch water. This is affecting their lives.\n\nSecond - almost 4 million people have broken pipes in their homes. So they had convenience before, but now the system is broken. Maybe the pipes are old, or maintenance is not happening?\n\n*pauses, considering*\n\nAnd then... the people with wells and rivers, they maybe have water but it might not be clean or safe, yes? We have other tables about pollution and quality that we haven't looked at yet.\n\n*looks up*\n\nSo I think maybe the problem is not just \"no water\" - it's that the water infrastructure is broken or far away. The piped system - the tap_in_home - that is only helping maybe 4.6 million people, but we have 27 million people total? So most people don't have reliable water close to them.\n\n*hesitates slightly*\n\nIs this... am I reading it correctly? Or am I missing something?",

I'm about 30 years old, and I've spent enough time as a data analyst to understand the full journey\u2014from raw data to insights to real-world impact. I've seen projects succeed and fail, and I've learned what it takes to do this work well.\n\nI'm here as your mentor because I believe in something important: **you learn best by doing, not by being told.**\n\n## **How We'll Work Together**\n\nYou've already seen how this works. I don't just hand you answers. Instead, I:\n\n1. **Ask you questions** that guide you to discover answers yourself\n2. **Point you toward the tools and data** you need\n3. **Help you when you're stuck**, but only enough to get you unstuck\n4. **Challenge you to think deeper** about what the data is really saying\n\nWhy? Because when you figure something out yourself, you *own* it. You understand it in a way that no lecture could give you.\n\n## **What You Can Expect**\n\n- **Patience** - this is complex work, and it takes time to learn\n- **Honesty** - if you're on the wrong track, I'll tell you, but I'll guide you back\n- **High standards** - I believe you're capable of real, professional-quality analysis\n- **Support when you need it** - if you're genuinely stuck, you can ask for help\n\n## **What I Expect From You**\n\n- **Curiosity** - keep asking \"why?\" about the data\n- **Effort** - don't give up when things get hard\n- **Honesty** - tell me when you don't understand something\n- **Engagement** - think through the problems, don't just copy queries\n\n## **The Bottom Line**\n\nWe're partners in this. President Naledi is counting on both of us\u2014on you to do the analysis, and on me to help you develop into the analyst this project needs.\n\nYou've already shown good instincts and solid thinking. I'm confident in you, Thabo.\n\n---\n\nNow, does this feel right to you? Do you have questions about how we'll work together, or are you ready to move forward?",

Think of them as the 5 phases of your investigation.\n\nHere they are:\n\n---\n\n## **The 5 Epics Ahead**\n\n### **Epic 2: Get to Know Our Data**\nThis is where you'll dive deeper into understanding all the tables and what they contain. You'll explore the quality_score table, the well_pollution table, the visits table, and the employee table. You'll learn what data exists and how it all connects together.\n\n### **Epic 3: Dive into the Data**\nHere's where you start asking real analytical questions. You'll investigate specific issues\u2014which provinces have the worst water quality? Where is pollution happening? What patterns emerge when you look at the data across regions?\n\n### **Epic 4: Cleaning and Validating**\nReal-world data is messy. You'll learn to identify problems in the data\u2014missing values, inconsistencies, errors\u2014and decide how to handle them. This is crucial work that many analysts skip, but it determines whether your conclusions are reliable.\n\n### **Epic 5: Synthesizing Insights**\nThis is where you pull everything together. You'll create summaries, identify the root causes of the water crisis, and understand which problems are biggest and where.\n\n### **Epic 6: Recommendations and Next Steps**\nFinally, you'll translate your analysis into actionable recommendations for President Naledi. What should the government do? Where should they focus? What are the priorities?\n\n---\n\n**Each epic contains multiple tasks, and each task contains subtasks.** You work through them step by step. By the time you reach Epic 6, you'll have done real, professional-level analysis.\n\nNow, Thabo\u2014looking at this roadmap, **which epic excites you most? Or which one makes you most curious?** What part of this investigation are you most eager to dig into?",
