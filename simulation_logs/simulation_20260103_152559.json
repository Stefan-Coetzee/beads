Rather than have you sit here while I fumble around, let me ask you directly:\n\n**Have you been given any SQL database access yet? Do you have a connection string, a database name, or instructions on how to connect to the water survey data?**\n\nThat might help me point you in the right direction. Because if you don't have that yet, then maybe there's a step we're missing before we can actually start querying.\n\nWhat have you got in front of you right now?",

No connection string, no database name, nothing like that.\n\n*looks back up*\n\nI have been reading messages from President Naledi and from you explaining the mission and the five tasks. But I haven't actually seen any real data or any instructions on how to connect to a database yet.\n\n*pauses thoughtfully*\n\nMaybe... the instructions for that are supposed to come in the next part? Like, when I actually start task 1? Or maybe there is a document I need to look for that has the database details?\n\n*sits back*\n\nI am ready to work, but I am waiting for you to show me where to go, is it? What should I be looking for?",
