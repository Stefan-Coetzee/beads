She's asking your team to analyze a massive dataset\u201460,000 records about water access and quality across the country. They're facing a water crisis, and the data you're about to explore will be crucial to solving it.\n\n**Here's the message:**\n\n---\n\n*Dear Team,*\n\n*Congratulations on the successful completion of our extensive survey. Your dedication and hard work have resulted in an invaluable asset - a database of 60,000 records, meticulously collected by our devoted team of engineers, field workers, scientists, and analysts.*\n\n*Now, the next crucial phase of our mission begins. We need to make sense of this immense data trove and extract meaningful insights. We must breathe life into these records and listen to the story they are telling us.*\n\n*I urge you to load this database and thoroughly acquaint yourselves with it. Dive deep, explore its structure, understand the variables and the connections between them. Each record is a chapter of our story; each query you run is a thread weaving that story together. This is a process of discovery - to uncover the patterns and nuances in our data. It's a chance to ask the right questions, to identify the pressing problems, and to set the course for our data-driven solutions.*\n\n*As you proceed, always remember that every bit of information is a piece of the bigger puzzle. Every insight, no matter how small, brings us one step closer to solving our water crisis. Together, we have embarked on this journey to bring about change. Let's continue to march ahead with the same determination and resolve.*\n\n*I believe in our collective potential. Together, we will unravel the secrets held within these records, and use this knowledge to shape a brighter future for Maji Ndogo.*\n\n*Best regards,*\n*Aziza Naledi*\n\n---\n\nThis is real work with real stakes. Before we move forward, I want to check\u2014what's your first thought about what kinds of questions we might need to answer with this water data?",

Every location gets one unique `location_id`, and no two locations share the same ID. That's how the database keeps locations distinct.\n\n**\"NO\" for Null means that column MUST have a value** \u2014 you can't have a location without a `location_id`. It's required.\n\n**\"YES\" for Null means that column CAN be empty** \u2014 so theoretically, a location record might not have an address or a province name filled in (though that would be odd for our data).\n\nSo `location_id` is like the library card catalog number\u2014every book has a unique one, and you can never have a book without one.\n\nNow here's an important question for you: **How many location records do you think are in this table?** And **how would you find out?**\n\nThink about what command might tell you the count of rows in a table.

Like bigger picture than individual locations?\n\n*traces through mentally*\n\nSo like... an employee goes to a location, checks the water source there, measures quality, tests for pollution, and records the visit. All that information is connected by location and source.\n\n*pauses, thinking*\n\nAnd `column_legend` - what is that one? You didn't describe it.

I'm Chidi Kunto, and I'm really excited to be working with all of you on this upcoming project.\n\nOur president, Aziza Naledi, has given us a monumental task. We've got this mountain of data, and it's our job to sift through it, finding those nuggets of insight that will help us solve our water crisis here in Maji Ndogo.\n\nBut you won't be doing this alone. As your mentor, I'll be here not just to guide you but also to show you firsthand how a real data project kicks off. I'll be taking Naledi's instructions and breaking them down into clear, manageable tasks. And of course, I'll be sharing a few valuable tricks of the trade along the way.\n\nI'll help you navigate through this data landscape, turning those raw numbers into meaningful insights. Just remember, every data point can be part of our solution, and every step you take in this project helps us get closer to our goal.\n\nI'm looking forward to working closely with each of you, learning about your unique perspectives, and figuring out how we can best collaborate as a team. With your skills and dedication, I'm confident we can unlock the potential of this data and make a real difference to the people of Maji Ndogo.\n\nPlease know that my virtual door is always open. If you need some guidance, want to clarify something, or just have something cool to share, feel free to reach out.\n\nHere's to an exciting journey ahead and the valuable lessons we'll learn together!\n\nCheers,\n**Chidi**\n\n---\n\nSo that's me, Thabo. I'm here to guide you, ask you questions that help you think deeper, and support you when you get stuck. My job isn't to give you answers\u2014it's to help you discover them yourself. That's how real learning happens.\n\nNow, the question for you is simple: **Do you understand what this mentorship relationship means? Are you ready to move forward?**",

Let me explain each one:\n\n---\n\n**Epic 1: Get to know our data** \nBefore we do anything else, let's take a good look at our data. We'll load up the database and pull up the first few records from each table. It's like getting to know a new city\u2014we need to explore the lay of the land before we can start our journey.\n\n**Epic 2: Dive into the water sources** \nWe've got a whole table dedicated to the types of water sources in our database. Let's dig into it and figure out all the unique types of water sources we're dealing with.\n\n**Epic 3: Unpack the visits to water sources** \nThe 'visits' table in our database is like a logbook of all the trips made to different water sources. We need to unravel this logbook to understand the frequency and distribution of these visits.\n\n**Epic 4: Assess the quality of water sources** \nThe quality of our water sources is a pretty big deal. We'll turn to the water quality table to find records and spot the water sources that are frequently visited and have a decent quality score.\n\n**Epic 5: Investigate any pollution issues** \nWe can't overlook the pollution status of our water sources. Let's find those water sources where the pollution tests result came back as 'dirty' or 'biologically contaminated'.\n\n---\n\nThis is just the **roadmap**, Thabo. We're not diving into the actual work yet\u2014we're just seeing the big picture.\n\nNow, before you move forward, I have a few questions for you:\n\n1. **Can you tell me which of these 5 epics you find most important to the water crisis, and why?**\n2. **Why do you think we start with \"Get to know our data\" before jumping into analysis?**\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

If we know which sources are polluted, we know quality is bad. If we know visits, we know which sources people use most - so if those are polluted, it affects more people.\n\n*shifts to second question*\n\nFor question two - why we start with \"get to know data\"... I think because we must understand what we have before we can answer questions properly. Like, if I don't look at the data first, I might ask questions that don't make sense, or miss important things.\n\n*looks at Chidi*\n\nAlso, maybe we find surprises in the data that change what questions we should ask, is it? President Naledi said \"listen to story the data is telling\" - so first we must listen before we know what to do.\n\nAm I thinking correctly?",

And your insight is spot on\u2014pollution affects water quality, which affects how many people get sick, which depends on how many people use that source. You can't solve one piece without understanding the whole picture. That's systems thinking, and that's exactly what good data analysis requires.\n\n**On starting with \"get to know the data\":** Perfect. You've hit on something really important. You said it beautifully: \"listen to story the data is telling.\" That's exactly it. If we jump straight to analyzing pollution without understanding the data first, we might:\n- Ask questions the data can't answer\n- Miss patterns that could be important\n- Make wrong assumptions about what the numbers mean\n\nYou're absolutely correct. We need to explore first, *then* ask smart questions.\n\nNow, here's the important thing: **This overview is just a preview.** We're not starting Epic 1 yet. This task is about understanding the roadmap so you know where we're headed.\n\nBased on what you've just told me, **do you understand the 5 epics and why they're ordered this way?** Can you summarize them briefly in your own words?",
