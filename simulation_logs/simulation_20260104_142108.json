Here's what she's shared with you:\n\n---\n\n**From President Naledi:**\n\n> Dear Team,\n>\n> Congratulations on the successful completion of our extensive survey. Your dedication and hard work have resulted in an invaluable asset - a database of 60,000 records, meticulously collected by our devoted team of engineers, field workers, scientists, and analysts.\n>\n> Now, the next crucial phase of our mission begins. We need to make sense of this immense data trove and extract meaningful insights. We must breathe life into these records and listen to the story they are telling us.\n>\n> I urge you to load this database and thoroughly acquaint yourselves with it. Dive deep, explore its structure, understand the variables and the connections between them. Each record is a chapter of our story; each query you run is a thread weaving that story together. This is a process of discovery - to uncover the patterns and nuances in our data. It's a chance to ask the right questions, to identify the pressing problems, and to set the course for our data-driven solutions.\n>\n> As you proceed, always remember that every bit of information is a piece of the bigger puzzle. Every insight, no matter how small, brings us one step closer to solving our water crisis. Together, we have embarked on this journey to bring about change. Let's continue to march ahead with the same determination and resolve.\n>\n> I believe in our collective potential. Together, we will unravel the secrets held within these records, and use this knowledge to shape a brighter future for Maji Ndogo.\n>\n> Best regards,  \n> Aziza Naledi\n\n---\n\nThis is real. 60,000 records. A country facing a water crisis. And you're about to become a data analyst helping solve it.\n\nBefore we move forward, I want to check in with you: **What's your initial reaction to this mission? What do you think we might need to discover in that data to actually help solve a water crisis?**",

My job is to help you *discover* answers. When you get stuck, I'll ask you questions. When you're not sure what to do next, I'll point you in a direction and let you walk it. That's how you actually learn this work \u2014 by doing it, not by watching someone else do it.\n\n**But I'm also here to support you.** If you're genuinely confused, if you hit a wall you can't get past, or if you need clarification on a concept \u2014 tell me. We'll work through it together. My goal is your success, not to make this harder than it needs to be.\n\n**What I expect from you:**\n- Curiosity. Keep asking \"why\" and \"what if.\"\n- Effort. Try things. Run queries. Make mistakes \u2014 they teach you more than getting it right the first time.\n- Honesty. If you don't understand something, say so. Don't pretend.\n\n**What you can expect from me:**\n- Patience. This is a real project with real stakes, but you're learning while doing it. That takes time.\n- Guidance. I'll help you think through problems, not solve them for you.\n- Belief in you. You already showed me today that you can explore a database, ask the right questions, and think strategically. That's not luck \u2014 that's skill.\n\nThis journey ahead is going to be intense. We're going to dig into data that reveals real problems in real communities. Some of what you find might be uncomfortable. But it matters. And you're going to be part of the solution.\n\nReady to keep going?",
