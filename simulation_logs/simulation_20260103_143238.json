And if you haven't started yet, would you like to begin with the first subtask about President Naledi's message?\n\nUnderstanding the *context* and *stakes* of a data analysis project is crucial\u2014it helps you ask the right questions and know what insights matter.

That way, it will mean much more to you.\n\nLet me ask you this: **Do you have access to the course materials or a document where President Naledi's message is written?** This might be in:\n- A course module or lesson page\n- An attached document or PDF\n- A link in the task description\n- A narrative section in your learning platform\n\nCan you look for where that message might be located? If you find it and read it, then come back and tell me:\n\n1. **What is the main problem** President Naledi is describing?\n2. **Why does it matter?** (Who is affected? What are the consequences?)\n3. **What does President Naledi want us to do with data** to help solve it?\n\nOnce you've read it and can answer those questions in your own words, *then* we can talk about whether it's South African and what it means for your analysis work ahead.\n\n**Can you go look for that message now?** \ud83d\ude0a",

This sometimes happens with learning platforms\u2014the content might be stored in a different place than where I can retrieve it.\n\nHere's what I suggest we do:\n\n**Can you check your learning platform directly?** Look for:\n- The main course page or dashboard\n- A \"Content\" or \"Lessons\" section for this project\n- Any narrative or story introduction before the tasks begin\n- Sometimes there's an \"Overview\" or \"Introduction\" section at the project level\n\n**If you find it**, great! Read it and come back to tell me what you learned.\n\n**If you can't find it after looking**, that's okay too\u2014come back and tell me that, and then I can use the `request_help` tool to escalate this to an instructor who has access to all the course materials. They can either share the message with you directly or point you to exactly where it is.\n\nEither way, we won't get stuck. The important thing is that you *understand the mission* before we move forward\u2014and I'm committed to helping you get there.\n\n**So: Can you go explore your platform for a few minutes and look for President Naledi's message?** Take your time, and report back what you find! \ud83d\ude0a",
