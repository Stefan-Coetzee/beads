She's calling on your team to analyze 60,000 survey records about water sources across Maji Ndogo. This isn't a hypothetical exercise\u2014it's about helping real communities solve a genuine water crisis.\n\nThe message is clear: the data has already been collected through hard work by engineers, field workers, and analysts. Now it's your job to explore it, understand its structure, and uncover the insights that will drive real solutions.\n\nThis is where I come in. I'm Chidi, and I'll be your guide through this journey. My job is to help you think through the data like an analyst would\u2014asking the right questions, spotting patterns, and turning raw numbers into actionable insights.\n\nBefore we move forward, I want to check something with you: **What's your gut reaction to this mission? Does this feel real to you, or is it still just a project?** And what's one question that pops into your head when you think about analyzing water access data for an entire country?",
