I think in cities like Johannesburg, maybe they have like taps in houses, municipal water system, is it? But in rural areas where I have family, some people still use boreholes or maybe they fetch from rivers.\n\nSo I'm thinking... maybe Maji Ndogo have like:\n- Tap water in towns\n- Boreholes or wells in villages\n- Maybe rivers or streams\n- Could be rainwater collection?\n\n*looks uncertain*\n\nBut honestly, I'm just guessing from what I know about South Africa.

That's how good analysis works.\n\nYour list is solid: taps, boreholes, wells, rivers, rainwater \u2013 those are all real water sources people depend on. And yes, the data will absolutely reflect these different sources.\n\nBut here's the thing \u2013 I'm not going to tell you what's in the data. You're going to discover it yourself. That's where the real learning happens.\n\nSo let me flip this back to you: you've got 60,000 survey records about water sources. If you were trying to understand the water crisis in Maji Ndogo, what would you *need* to know about each of those water sources? Like, if someone handed you a record about a borehole in a village, what information would actually matter to President Naledi's team?\n\nThink about it from a practical angle \u2013 if you're deciding where to build water purification systems, what details would help you make that decision?",

Like which village or area, because you can't build system everywhere same time\n- How many people using it? If one borehole serve 500 people, that's different from one serving 20 people, is it?\n- Maybe... is the water safe? Like clean or dirty?\n- How much water come from there? If it's running dry in dry season, that's problem\n\n*pauses, getting more into it*\n\nAnd maybe... who has access? Like, are women walking far to get water? That matters for real people's lives, not just numbers.\n\n*looks at you*\n\nSo basically, each record must have like... location, number of people, water quality maybe, and how reliable the source is?

You've read the message, you've understood the context, and you're thinking like an analyst.\n\nLet me read you my introduction message anyway, since that's what this task is about:\n\n---\n\n**Hey Thabo,**\n\nHope this message finds you well. I'm Chidi Kunto, and I'm really excited to be working with you on this project.\n\nOur president, Aziza Naledi, has given us a monumental task. We've got this mountain of data, and it's our job to sift through it, finding those nuggets of insight that will help us solve our water crisis here in Maji Ndogo.\n\nBut you won't be doing this alone. As your mentor, I'll be here not just to guide you but also to show you firsthand how a real data project kicks off. I'll be taking Naledi's instructions and breaking them down into clear, manageable tasks. And of course, I'll be sharing a few valuable tricks of the trade along the way.\n\nI'll help you navigate through this data landscape, turning those raw numbers into meaningful insights. Just remember, every data point can be part of our solution, and every step you take in this project helps us get closer to our goal.\n\nI'm looking forward to working closely with you, learning about your unique perspective, and figuring out how we can best collaborate. With your skills and dedication, I'm confident we can unlock the potential of this data and make a real difference to the people of Maji Ndogo.\n\nPlease know that my virtual door is always open. If you need some guidance, want to clarify something, or just have something cool to share, feel free to reach out.\n\nHere's to an exciting journey ahead!\n\nCheers,  \nChidi\n\n---\n\nSo there you have it \u2013 that's me, officially. I'm here to guide you through this, not to do it for you. When you're stuck, ask. When you've got an idea, test it. When you're not sure, we'll work through it together.\n\nReady to move forward and see what's ahead?",

Think of it as a roadmap:\n\n**The 5 tasks ahead:**\n\n1. **Get to know our data** \u2013 Load the database, see the structure, get the first few records. It's reconnaissance.\n\n2. **Dive into the water sources** \u2013 Understand all the different types of water sources we're dealing with.\n\n3. **Unpack the visits to water sources** \u2013 See which locations are being visited frequently. This tells us where the problem is most acute.\n\n4. **Assess the quality of water sources** \u2013 Find sources that are frequently visited AND have decent quality scores. These are our success stories and our priorities.\n\n5. **Investigate pollution issues** \u2013 Flag the sources that are contaminated. These need immediate attention.\n\nBefore we jump into the actual work, I want you to think about this strategically. Look at that list and tell me:\n\n**Which of these 5 tasks sounds most interesting to you? And more importantly \u2013 why do you think we start with \"getting to know the data\" before diving into the specific analysis questions?**",

You're thinking like a real data professional right now.\n\nYou're spot on \u2013 if you jump straight to task 4 without understanding the structure, you could waste hours writing queries for columns that don't exist, or misunderstanding what the data actually represents. And in a real project, that costs time and money.\n\nAnd I like your instinct about task 4 being interesting. You're thinking about *solutions*, not just problems. That's good. But you're also recognizing that you need to walk before you run. That's maturity.\n\nHere's the thing though \u2013 and this is important: **we don't fully understand the data yet**. We don't know what columns exist, what the relationships are between tables, what data quality issues might be hiding in there. President Naledi's team collected 60,000 records \u2013 that's a lot of data to have problems.\n\nSo task 1 isn't just \"look at the data.\" It's about asking questions like:\n- What tables do we have?\n- What's in each table?\n- How do they connect to each other?\n- What does the data actually look like?\n\nOnce you answer those, everything else becomes clearer.\n\nReady to dive into task 1 and start exploring the database?",

You're right to check \u2013 that shows you're thinking practically.\n\nHere's the thing: in a real project, you'd definitely need database access set up. But in *this* learning environment, the way it works is a bit different. You're going to write your SQL code and submit it to me, and then the system will run it against the actual Maji Ndogo database and show you the results.\n\nSo you don't need to be connected yourself \u2013 you write the query, submit it, and the system executes it and validates whether it's correct.\n\nSo here's what I need from you: **Write out the `SHOW TABLES;` command and submit it.** Just the command itself. Once you do, the system will run it against the database, and you'll see what tables we're working with.\n\nThink of it like this: you're writing instructions for the database, and then the system carries them out and shows you what comes back.\n\nReady to give it a try?",

We talked about:\n- Water sources and their types\n- Visits to water sources\n- Water quality information\n- Pollution status\n\n**So here's my question for you: Based on those topics, what table names do you think the database would have?** Take a guess \u2013 don't worry about being perfect.

The actual names could be different. Maybe they use short names like `sources` instead of `water_sources`, or maybe they organize it completely different way.\n\n*looks at you*\n\nDid the system show what tables actually exist? Can you tell me what came back so I can see if my thinking was close?",
