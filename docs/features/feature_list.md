# List of features important for PoC. 

1. Login or LTI spin up. We have to track their email + progress and final grade. 
2. Response should be streamed
3. We should catch Python errors in browser to avoid a next js error
4. We can probably truncate conversation at the task level - 1 task, 1 context
5. Need context window compression
6. Needs avatar & design
7. Chat needs history reload
8. Safe and simple deployment - Mike about simple auth, or cookie read? 
9. Comprehensive tests. 
10. Ensure default comments are there, and ensure those comments are scrubbed. Or should be shown somehow as external. 
11. Add explainer focus - here is project, code, etc. 
12. Log user data to simple gradebook. 
13. Set up policy - if fail, what then
14. On first load, intro should be better, and ideally contextual to the project (first_message kinda thing)
