 Hey Claude, so I want to build a project workspace. The idea is that a learner logs in. Or not even log in, don't build any logins. So the page looks like this. The workspace looks like this. There should be two panes. One pane would be where we would have a general tech workspace. Like an IDE. In some cases, at the start that would be SQL. And for other cases, let's just build a simple, either JavaScript or Python terminal inside of a web page. The second pane should be co-pilot. And it should be using an API that we've just built. And I think it's documented in source/api folder. And it is essentially a project. So kind of leading learners through a project. But it's using the idea of epics, tasks and subtasks. I think on the left hand pane you would just have a chat space where you would have a conversation with an LLM. And on the other side you would have some sort of IDE that would have probably a place where you can write some simple code. And then a place where the result sets or the output of that code is sent to. And so in this chat pane we would generally have some messages, the ability to send messages. I mean we can use AI Assistant UI. There's a relatively new package for that. That has standard libraries for all of these components. But in addition I want to have the system where we are able to track those tasks. For example if you click, if the LLM says you know, if closed task 1.115, then if you hover over it, click on it. There should be kind of like on a Jira page, there's this side swiping pane that comes up and shows you that, what the details about that task. Okay, so that's kind of the main space. But secondary to that, so like easily accessible should be pretty much a can-do board that has the epics and tasks sort of set up in a visual manner laid out so that you as a learner might be able to understand what the structure of the project is slightly. And when I think about that part, I think we should be careful of building that. So let's ignore the Can-Ban board for now. The main point is as a learner logging in, they want to go through this entire process of a project. So for the first one, this is just a MySQL project, so there should be a MySQL kind of mimicking, just a place where you can put in your query and execute it. If there's any fancy features you can have with that or any plugins that already have some good packages that we can use, that's brilliant. I believe my SQL, sorry, not my SQL, the SQL made a mystery, had a SQL.js where they mounted a database in the browser of a person using it. And so that might be an option. So you would have a learner ID, your own learner ID. There would be specific projects and I believe in the database there should be an assignment for that project. Like you are enrolled in a project otherwise at this point there's just one project. So I think what would be useful is if we have sort of a huge overview of epics, so there are some high level context and tasks, and maybe we have a page that just lays out everything hierarchically so that you can just expand stuff and you should be able to kind of see where you are. Ideally we also want to track progress on that page, so if a learner logs in they can very quickly identify which step they need to go to. So to summarize this, we need two pages. The first page is like a homepage, you log in, you see the project that you've been working on and you can see the progress of that project with like expandable things and pretty small queries to fetch all of this database or all of this data from the API. The second page is the co-lab space, the co-pilot space. So on the left hand side you would have something like an IDE, something like a terminal output, and on the right hand side you would have a chat interface with all the standard components. We could reset conversations. I believe chat assistant UI has a complete thread management entire system that ties into LangGolf that we should try and pick it back off. And the idea again is that a learner should be able to chat to the LLM and go through some steps, but I think what's really critically important is that we send the contents of both the IDE and the result set back through the queries. So one of the things we send back is the actual interface data, the stuff that they are seeing. And so that the LLM just naturally understands what is visible in the user's interface. So what I want you to do is think at a very detailed level through kind of a product requirements document, planning out what are the changes needed for the front end, for the back end, use a simple thing like React or whatever is most suitable. Try your very best to use existing packages and not create a bunch of boilerplate code that already exists somewhere. So for example, please the chat interface, there is a complete standard library we can just pull out an interface with. So it's really important that we try and do that as far as we can.
